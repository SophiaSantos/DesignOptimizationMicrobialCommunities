Microbial communities are widespread in nature and have been recognized to be more adequate in industrial settings than pure cultures, especially regarding the robustness towards contaminations. 
Moreover, the metabolic capabilities can be greatly extended when compared with individual species. However, very few applications have been described besides the production of food products using natural communities. 
In order to use fully the industrial potential of microbial communities it is important to be able to customize their behavior by optimizing the composition both in terms of species and genes, as well as optimizing the environmental conditions.

This work here published is part of my PhD thesis and aims at contributing to developing optimized microbial communities for the production of a target compound by improving both modeling and simulation methods and developing metabolic engineering tools. 
The in silico results will be applied to the optimization of the production of cellulose by Sulfuhydrogenibium azorense Az-Fu in a co-culture system.
